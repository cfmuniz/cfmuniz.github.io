title: "Birdwatching cams"
---

A couple of weeks ago I discovered that many bird feeders across the world are fitted with cameras that broadcast a live feed to YouTube. I was beyond excited to discover these cams and I have since found multiple interesting cams that I keep an eye on often. 

I think that this is an awesome initiative to bring nature programs closer to the broad public. Not only it is delightful to work with the sound of birds chirping in the background, but it is also an excellent way to brush up your identification skills and to learn about species outside your area.

Since I check on the cams' visitors everyday, I thought that putting together a basic page in HTML could save me the trouble of opening and combining windows. To view the page with four particularly fruitful cams (no pun intended) you can click on this [link](/birdwatcher/birdwatcher-page.html), or on the image.
