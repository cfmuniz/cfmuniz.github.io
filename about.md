Hi! I am Carlota, a marine ecologist by training who got curious about statistics and data analysis while doing my Ph.D.

In 2014 I moved from Spain to South Africa to study a masters by research involving one of my favourite topics: intertidal invertebrates. And while studying the relationship of harmful algal blooms, and the early stages of development of mussels and barnacles, there was R. Some environmental data later, the project turned into a Ph.D. which showed me the joys of finding meaning in data.

Some time after that, I still continue learning with the goal of building a career in data science and analytics (now more focused on adding other programming languages and machine learning techniques to my tool box). I am an enthusiastic course-taker, and not only because of the course contents. I have enjoyed sharing the joys of data analytics with other postgraduate students, and I would like to learn how to better convey those ideas for other people to appreciate data in the same way.

In my spare time I am a keen birdwatcher *aficionado*, which makes travelling a bit heavier because of the binoculars. And of course, like any other person in marine sciences, I am a keen diver.
